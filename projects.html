<h1> Projects </h1>
<h2> Electronic Audio Synthesizer</h2>
<p>Implemented a Java application where the user is allowed to digitally play notes on the GUI using their mouse.
    Users can adjust the octave of the notes as well as the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the played notes.
    Additionally, users also have the option to play harmonics and adjust the master volume.</p>

<h2>Electronic ATM Simulator</h2>
<p>Constructed a C# application that simulates an ATM. Users were allowed to make an account in which they
    could log in and out within the application. Once logged in, users had the option of depositing, withdrawing,
    checking their balance, and checking their account history. Each account would have its data saved locally.</p>
